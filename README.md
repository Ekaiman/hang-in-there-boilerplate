# Hang In There

This project allows the user to create a motivational poster. The user can view
a randomly generated poster that contains an image, title, and quote
pre-provided by the website. They also have the option to provide their own
image, title, and quote to create a customized poster. These posters can then be
saved and viewed in a saved poster section.
